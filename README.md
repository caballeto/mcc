This repository is my attempt in implementing
a compiler for a subset of C language. The primary goal is to get
more practice with hands-on implementation of a real language. 
The compiler is written in C++, accept C files and generates X86-64 assembly output.

## Layout

- `examples/` contains sample example files and corresponding assembly generated by gcc
- `src/` contains all compiler source files
- `tests/` contains tests in form of a program and expected program output
- `LOG.md` contains the working log on the project, describing some design decisions and general dev process
